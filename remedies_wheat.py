Biodiversity among wheat cultivars can also effectively check the rust problem. 
Use 3-4 wheat varieties at a time on each farm. Avoid late sowing or late 
maturing varieties. To protect the crop from rust infection, spray 5 liters of 
sour buttermilk mixed with 200 liter of water. Amaranth (chaulai or lal bhaji â€“ 
a common green leaf vegetable) or Mentha (Pudina) leaf dust can also be used as 
fine spray (25- 30 gm dry leaf powder per lit of water) to prevent the infection 
of rusts. Foliar spray of dry leaf extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (China 
rose) can also prevent the rust infection."""
